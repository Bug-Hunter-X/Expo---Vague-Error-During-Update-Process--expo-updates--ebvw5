# Expo Updates Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `expo-updates` package in an Expo application. The app functions correctly in development mode but fails to update when built for release. The error message from `expo-updates` is vague, making debugging difficult.

## Problem Description

The primary issue is the lack of specific error details during the update process. The app shows no clear indication of why the update fails.

## Solution

The solution involves a combination of improved error handling using try-catch statements and logging the network response for debugging. This helps pinpoint the source of the issue more precisely. Detailed steps are provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.

## How to reproduce

2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app in development mode to confirm its functionality (This step should not result in errors).
4. Build the app for release using EAS or similar tools.
5. Attempt to update the app. The update will fail, providing a vague error message.
