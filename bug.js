While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the expo-updates package.  The error message was vague, mentioning a problem with downloading the update but not specifying the root cause. The app functioned correctly in development mode, but failed to update when built for release.  I've checked the network connectivity and confirmed no firewall restrictions are blocking the update process.  My expo-updates configuration appears to be correctly set up, based on the official documentation.
